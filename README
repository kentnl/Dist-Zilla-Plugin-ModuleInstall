    Distributions with Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 1.000002

SYNOPSIS
    dist.ini

        [ModuleInstall]

DESCRIPTION
    This module will create a Makefile.PL for installing the dist using
    "Module::Install".

    It is at present a very minimal feature set, but it works.

METHODS
  register_prereqs
    Tells Dist::Zilla about our needs to have EU::MM larger than 6.42

  setup_installer
    Generates the Makefile.PL, and runs it in a tmpdir, and then harvests
    the output and stores it in the dist selectively.
