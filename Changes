Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-ModuleInstall

0.01029216 2010-08-04 23:37:06 Pacific/Auckland
        Upgraded codebase to work with DZil 4. 
        New support for build/test/config/recommends phases.
        Now dies and leaves you in the tempdir if it manages to generate 
          a fubared Makefile.PL
        Now using Latest Role::Tempdir
        General overhaul of everything.
        This release hopefully resolves rt #55840 ( reported by Salve J. Nilsen )
        This now ships its own default test-runner. 
        Attempted support at supporting scripts via :ExecFiles
        More errors moved to occur in the dzil phase, not in the templater 
          ( which suppresses sneaky errors that I had happening because the code
            in the templates were dying, and emitting "hurp, something failed" into the
            template, which, being perl code, wasn't too great )
        Emitted Makefile.PL has more comments explaining whats happening.
        Injects a "Hey, don't modify this file!" warning.
